<br>

#### Application of Partial Least Squares (PLS) Dimension Reduction
##### *Guide: Prof. Suyash Awate, Spring 2016*
Implemented a regression using PLS dimensionality reduction and used it to obtain better classification results against SVM & PCA based methods on datasets with high dimensionality.

#### Second Order Cone Programming for Robust Least Squares
##### *Guide: Prof. Ganesh Ramakrishnan, Autumn 2015*
Implemented Barrier method and Primal Dual Interior Point methods in Python and used it
to analyze their convergence on Robust Least Squares problem formulated as SOCP.
