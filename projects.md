Following are some of the projects I have done at IIT Bombay. (Undergraduate Projects)

****
<br>

#### Application of Partial Least Squares (PLS) Dimension Reduction
##### *Guide: Prof. Suyash Awate, Spring 2016*
Implemented a regression using PLS dimensionality reduction and used it to obtain better classification results against SVM & PCA based methods on datasets with high dimensionality. 
[Report](https://adityakumarakash.github.io/project/mip_project.pdf)

<br>

#### Second Order Cone Programming for Robust Least Squares
##### *Guide: Prof. Ganesh Ramakrishnan, Autumn 2015*
Implemented Barrier method and Primal Dual Interior Point methods in Python and used it
to analyze their convergence on Robust Least Squares problem formulated as SOCP. 
[Report](https://adityakumarakash.github.io/project/convex_opt_report.pdf)

<br>

#### Threading and Scheduling in GeekOS
##### *Guide: Prof. D. M. Dhamdhere, Spring 2015*
Added multilevel and round robin scheduling policy in GeekOS, an experimental OS. Implemented kernel and user level thread creations, and deadlock handling.

<br>

#### Code Corpus
##### *Guide: Prof. N. L. Sharda, Autumn 2014*
Created a corpus for competitive programming problems with sophisticated search options. Added intelligent options for auto suggestion of problems and users to follow.

#### SlitherLink Puzzle solver
##### *Guide: Prof. Amitabh Sanyal, Spring 2013*
Developed in MIT-Scheme a solver for SlitherLink puzzle. Implemented a self designed algorithm which used concepts of intelligent backtracking.
