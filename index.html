        <p class="Describe">Hello, I am a PhD student at <a href="https://www.cs.wisc.edu/">UW Madison</a>. Previously, I worked as a software engineer at Google, Bangalore.
                <br>
        I completed my Bachelors in <a href= "https://www.cse.iitb.ac.in/">Computer Science and Engineering</a> with Honors at <a href = "http://iitb.ac.in/">Indian Institute of Technology, Bombay</a>, in 2016. 
        I love yoga and hiking.

        <h3> Research Interests </h3>
        Currently, I am working on how various constraints can be incorporated in deep learning models, and
relevant optimization techniques for training them faster. I am also looking into potential applications of this in medical image analysis.
        <br>
        Broadly speaking, following are my areas of interests:-
                <ul>
                        <li>Deep Learning</li>
                        <li>Artifical Intelligence</li>
                        <li>Computer Vision</li>
                </ul>
