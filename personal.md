I am from [Jasidih](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jasidih), a city in Deoghar district in the Indian state of Jharkhand. Deoghar, a word in hindi with the literal meaning ‘abode (ghar) of gods and godesses‘ is the cultural capital of Jharkhand. See my [blog](https://adityakumarakash.wordpress.com/2013/01/22/a-picturesque-of-my-home-town/) to learn more about my hometown.

I did my matriculation from St. Francis School, Jasidih. I then moved to DPS bokaro for my senior secondary education. Later, I did my Bachelor's from IIT Bombay, Mumbai. Currently, I am working at Google, Bangalore.

I love playing pool and table tennis. My team was runners-up in recently concluded pool tournament at Google. 

I am passionate about yoga and hiking. Helps me enjoy a balanced life :relaxed:.
