#### Learning Invariant Representation using Inverse Contrastive Loss (ICL)
##### Guide : Prof. Vikas Singh, *Spring 2020*
* Introduced ICL to learn learn representations invariant to an extraneous variable of interest
* For special cases, ICL simplifies to regularized MMD divergence
* Applications in learning unbiased representations and pooling multi-site data

#### FairALM: Augmented lagrangian method for training fair models with littleregret
##### Guide: Prof Vikas Singh *Fall 2019*
* Joint work on imposing fairness constraints on deep models for computer vision
* The proposed augmented Lagrangian method leads to a stable and consistent enforcementof constraint which improves the interpretability of deep models

#### Model Fusion using Optimal Transport Framework
##### Guide: Prof Nicolas Garcia Trillos, *Fall 2021, Ongoing*
* Working on a principled approach to combine multiple deep models using optimal transport
* Our proposed framework unifies the existing ad hoc methods and has applications inknowledge distillation and federated learning

#### Stochastic bandits with delayed composite anonymous feedback
##### NeurIPS 2019 Workshop on Machine Learning with Guarantees
* Extended multi-armed bandits to a novel setting for real world scenarios like clinical trialswith delayed and anonymous rewards 
* Proposed phase based UCB algorithm to obtain sublinear regret
