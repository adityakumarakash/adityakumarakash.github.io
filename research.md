### Consensus-based Active Learning Strategy for Multi-Label Classification
#### Guide : Prof. Ganesh Ramakrishnan
* Worked on problem of multilabel classification for predicting video tags
* The problem involved multiple human and machine labelers; and required transitioning from scarce labelled data start to a warm-start setting
* Designed a novel active learning based strategy that optimizes the cost of labeling, labeler reliability and inter-labeler consensus
* Demonstrated better classification results on real-world datasets with fewer labeled data than state-of-the-art methods

### Application of Probabilistic Principal Component Analysis (PPCA)
#### Guide : Prof. Suyash Awate
* Analyzed applications of PPCA for cases in which data vectors exhibit missing values
* Investigated the comparative performance of PPCA against variants of standard PCA for estimating missing data
* Empirically concluded that PPCA would perform better when data has inherent mixture model distribution

### Local counter-based policies for robot patrolling
#### Guide : Prof. Sandor Fekete
* Worked on theoretical aspects of swarm of mobile robots exploring an arbitrary graph
* Researched in detail LRV (Least Recently Visited) patrolling policies and established a new, previously unknown, lower bound on LRV-vertex policy
* Contributed to aspects of a possible new upper bound using edge based patrolling policies
* The work led to publications in ICRA and WALCOM
