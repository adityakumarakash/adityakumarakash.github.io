#### Learning Invariant Representation using Inverse Contrastive Loss (ICL)
##### Guide : Prof. Vikas Singh, *Spring 2020*
* Introduced ICL to learn learn representations invariant to an extraneous variable of interest
* For special cases, ICL simplifies to regularized MMD divergence
* Applications in learning unbiased representations and pooling multi-site data

#### FairALM: Augmented lagrangian method for training fair models with littleregret
##### Guide: Prof Vikas Singh *Fall 2019*
* Joint work on imposing fairness constraints on deep models for computer vision
* The proposed augmented Lagrangian method leads to a stable and consistent enforcementof constraint which improves the interpretability of deep models

#### Model Fusion using Optimal Transport Framework
##### Guide: Prof Nicolas Garcia Trillos, *Fall 2020, Ongoing*
* Working on a principled approach to combine multiple deep models using optimal transport
* Our proposed framework unifies the existing ad hoc methods and has applications inknowledge distillation and federated learning

<br>

#### Stochastic bandits with delayed composite anonymous feedback
##### NeurIPS 2019 Workshop on Machine Learning with Guarantees
* Extended multi-armed bandits to a novel setting for real world scenarios like clinical trialswith delayed and anonymous rewards 
* Proposed phase based UCB algorithm to obtain sublinear regret

## Undergraduate Research Work:

****
<br>

#### Consensus-based Active Learning Strategy for Multi-Label Classification
##### Guide : Prof. Ganesh Ramakrishnan
* Worked on problem of multilabel classification for predicting video tags
* The problem involved multiple human and machine labelers; and required transitioning from scarce labelled data start to a warm-start setting
* Designed a novel active learning based strategy that optimizes the cost of labeling, labeler reliability and inter-labeler consensus
* Demonstrated better classification results on real-world datasets with fewer labeled data than state-of-the-art methods

#### Application of Probabilistic Principal Component Analysis (PPCA)
##### Guide : Prof. Suyash Awate
* Analyzed applications of PPCA for cases in which data vectors exhibit missing values
* Investigated the comparative performance of PPCA against variants of standard PCA for estimating missing data
* Empirically concluded that PPCA would perform better when data has inherent mixture model distribution

#### Local counter-based policies for robot patrolling
##### Guide : Prof. Sandor Fekete
* Worked on theoretical aspects of swarm of mobile robots exploring an arbitrary graph
* Researched in detail LRV (Least Recently Visited) patrolling policies and established a new, previously unknown, lower bound on LRV-vertex policy
* Contributed to aspects of a possible new upper bound using edge based patrolling policies
* The work led to publications in ICRA and WALCOM
